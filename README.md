# AnimalProcessing
Stuff that animals process that humans 

Looking at the Dallas Zoo Elephant area, they have the right foilage to indicate consubstantiation.  However, unlike a normal type of altar?, there are a lot of distractions. There's hardly any information to this, I'm still trying to figure out why the magnetic fields just start spinning, I found a book in the public library, but a lot of the interactions are black box and this year or the last, there are a lot of wild animal cameras.

The `anti-helix` on my left ear has split and my ears are now mobile, and there are eye, tongue and palate changes, along with a lot of other stuff.

### Movement
Not everyone is going to have the perfect pond scum culture around them, sometimes it takes a little bit more animal help to get it nice.  Also, animals can help diffuse pack behaviors.
